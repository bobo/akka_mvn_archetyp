A simple example mvn archetype for a akka project.
The source should be improved to provide a more usefull akka skeleton.

to use:
git clone git://github.com/bobo/akka_mvn_archetyp.git
cd akka_mvn_archetyp
mvn install
then somewhere else in a folder you want your project:
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local
and follow the guide, you should have a archetype named something like: akka_sample_java-archetype 
in the list.

then you can do mvn test and if you have redis running it should pass
